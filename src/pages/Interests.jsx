                <p>I'm an introvert, so my heaven usually consists of staying home. What do I do, you may ask? Well, I have Netflix, Disney+, my phone, my beloved TV, my fast Wi-Fi, and my bed. Watching stuff, playing on my phone, or just sleep is how I spend most of my time. TLDR; I love watching movies and TV shows.
                </p>
                <p>Oh, I'm a reader too. Usually fiction books because why would I need to read non-fiction when my life is already the non-fiction?</p>
                <p> I learn world language too, sometimes. Currently working on my Korean.</p>
